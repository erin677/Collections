              <p class="sub-heading">
                My PC build began in January 2021 when I first became interested in computers 
                when my ex boyfriend introduced them to me. It began with the case and spread from there. 
                Of course there were a few bumps in the road, especially with the lack of graphics 
                cards on the market.  <br>
                At the moment, the PC works but only for a few moments and then it overheats, 
                I have to reapply the thermal paste on the CPU, which I have been ignoring for months 
                because getting the CPU on in the first place was the equivalent of running a marathon. 
                And so it sits on my desk as the most expensive paper weight I have ever owned in my life.

                    <h1> My Walmart Hat</h1>
                    <p class="sub-heading">My walmart career began in September 2020 as a Fulfillment associate, 
                      we basically unload the trucks and put all the shit on the shelf. 
                      As a walmart associate there are many responsibilities I have which include 
                      helping customers and occasionally standing in the back doing nothing. 
                      Sometimes we even play baseball in the back with a broom.   <br>
                      As for the Walmart Hat, I love my Walmart Hat. It makes my head 
                    sweatier than a hippo in the dessert but its totally worth it for two reasons; 
                    1. Im a proud Walmart associate and love to represent my walmart pride 2. 
                    I look so GOOD in my walmart hat its insane.
