                My PC build began in January 2021 when I first became interested in computers 
                when my ex boyfriend introduced them to me. It began with the case and spread from there. 
                Of course there were a few bumps in the road, especially with the lack of graphics 
                cards on the market.  <br>
                At the moment, the PC works but only for a few moments and then it overheats, 
                I have to reapply the thermal paste on the CPU, which I have been ignoring for months 
                because getting the CPU on in the first place was the equivalent of running a marathon. 
                And so it sits on my desk as the most expensive paper weight I have ever owned in my life.
